Overview
Human Activity Recognition using Deep Learning Neural Network
Human Activity Recognition(HAR) is classifying activity of a person using  the data from responsive sensors that are affected from human movement. This project presents a human activity recognition  method using a deep neural network with hyperparameter tuning.
Keras Tuner is used to perform hyperparameter tuning with tensorflow2.0.
Dataset 
The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.
